	<H1>About</h1>
	<p> Before, I was working/student in a fast food chain, and now I'm in chat support group. It's not really easy having both working and studying at the same time.
	While studying and I always motivate myself to do the things that I want to do to achieve in life. 
	Then, I've realize that becoming a college student is not easy you'll face a serious and matured life working in the night shift and in the morning while studying.<BR><BR>
	
	When I was a child, I always loved to interact with people. I like to know people and make friends. I am a extrovert person and go out with my friends and family. Also, I like to visit new places, the nature really amaze me.
	Therefore, whenever I go to vacation I always insist on my friends and family for a getaway in natureâ€™s. Traveling gives me so much happiness. I always capture beautiful moments and places in my camera.
	Whenever I am sad, I revisit my photo album to look at the beautiful places and moments.The thought of those happy moments and beautiful places makes me happy.
